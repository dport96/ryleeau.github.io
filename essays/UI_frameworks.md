UI Frameworks, although just another thing to learn in the coding world, works in that there are benefits of using this over HTML and CSS. For one, there are pre-built components that significantly improve the speed and efficiency for programmers. The alternative is to write HTML and CSS code by hand which takes significantly longer and raises the risk of errors. In addition, mobile responsiveness in UI Frameworks allows applications to work well with various screen sizes using the pre-built components. 

In my ICS 314 class, I learned to use bootstrap 5 to recreate a website page. One benefit that I immediately noticed was the omission of a separate CSS file. It made for easier code to read and a more uniform system of coding and maintenance detection. In addition, the mobile responsiveness was something that my previous HTML and CSS website page lacked. Although it was tricky to learn another process of webpage creation, I found this process to be much easier than all the separate files in HTML and CSS.

Using UI Frameworks like bootstrap is not only time efficient for programmers, but also functionally beneficial. The initial investment of time and frustration in learning UI Frameworks is worth the future efficiency and saved time.
